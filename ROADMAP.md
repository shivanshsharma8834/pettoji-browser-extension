A detailed developer roadmap for creating a browser extension like Shimeji involves a combination of fundamental browser extension development knowledge and specific features that bring the animated characters to life. Here is a step-by-step guide, along with additional features to enhance the extension.

### Phase 1: Foundation - Basic Browser Extension

This phase focuses on setting up the essential components of a browser extension.

**1. Learn the Basics of Browser Extensions**

- **Understand the Core Components:**
    - **Manifest V3:** The starting point of your extension. It's a JSON file that declares the extension's name, version, permissions, and the scripts it uses.
    - **Content Scripts:** JavaScript files that run in the context of a web page. This is how your Shimeji will be injected into and interact with the webpage.
    - **Background Scripts (Service Workers):** Run in the background to handle events and manage the extension's overall logic.
    - **Popup:** An HTML file that provides a user interface when the extension's icon is clicked.
- **Prerequisites:**
    - Proficiency in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** is essential.
    - Familiarity with a text editor like **VS Code**.
    - A **Google Chrome** browser for testing.

**2. Set Up Your Development Environment**

- **Create a Project Folder:**
    - Create a new folder for your extension.
    - Inside, create the initial files: `manifest.json`, `content.js`, and `styles.css`.
- **Configure the `manifest.json` File:**
    - Define the `manifest_version`, `name`, `description`, and `version`.
    - Specify the necessary permissions, such as `"activeTab"` and `"scripting"`.
    - Declare your content scripts, background scripts, and popup.

**3. "Hello, World!" Extension**

- **Create a Simple Extension:** Build a basic extension that injects a simple message or a banner into a webpage to understand how the different parts work together.
- **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
    - Go to `chrome://extensions`.
    - Enable "Developer mode".
    - Click "Load unpacked" and select your project folder.

### Phase 2: Core Shimeji Features - The Animated Character

This phase focuses on getting the animated character to appear on the screen.

**1. Character Sprites and Animation**

- **Create or Obtain Character Sprites:**
    - You'll need a "sprite sheet" for your character, which is a single image containing all the frames of animation (walking, idling, jumping, etc.).
    - You can draw your own, or find artists who create them.
- **Display the Character:**
    - Use a content script to inject an `<img>` or a `<div>` with the character's sprite as the background into the current webpage.
    - Position the character using CSS (e.g., `position: fixed`).

**2. Animation Loop**

- **Implement a Basic Animation Loop:**
    - Use JavaScript's `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth animations.
    - This loop will be responsible for updating the character's state and position on each frame.
- **Sprite Animation:**
    - Within the animation loop, change the `background-position` of your character's `<div>` to cycle through the frames of the sprite sheet, creating the illusion of movement.

### Phase 3: Interaction and Animation

This is where you bring your Shimeji to life.

**1. Movement and Physics**

- **Implement Basic Movement:**
    - Define the character's behavior, such as walking from one side of the screen to the other.
    - Use JavaScript to update the character's `x` and `y` coordinates.
- **Gravity and Jumping:**
    - Implement a simple gravity effect that pulls the character down.
    - Add the ability for the character to jump.

**2. Interaction with the Browser Window and Page Elements**

- **Collision Detection:**
    - Detect the edges of the browser window to make the character "walk" on the bottom of the screen or "climb" the sides.
    - Detect other HTML elements on the page, allowing the character to walk on top of them.
- **Mouse Interaction:**
    - Implement drag-and-drop functionality so the user can pick up the Shimeji with their mouse and move it around.

### Phase 4: User Customization and Interface

**1. Popup and User Interface**

- **Create a Popup Menu:**
    - Design a `popup.html` file that allows users to select a character, add more Shimejis to the screen, or customize their behavior.
    - This will require communication between your popup script and your content scripts.

**2. Character Selection**

- **Character Directory:**
    - Create a library of Shimeji characters that users can choose from.
    - Each character might have its own unique sprite sheet and behaviors.

### Additional Features to Make it Better

- **Interactive Elements:** Allow the Shimeji to interact with specific website elements in unique ways. For example, they could "steal" buttons or "eat" images.
- **Multi-Shimeji Interaction:** If a user has multiple Shimejis on the screen, have them interact with each other.
- **Custom Character Uploader:** Let users upload their own Shimeji sprite sheets.
- **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for actions like jumping or falling.
- **AI-Powered Behavior:** Use a simple AI model to give the Shimejis more complex and unpredictable behavior.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** While you may start with Chrome, consider making your extension compatible with Firefox and other browsers.
- **Monetization:**
    - **Freemium Model:** Offer a selection of free characters and a premium set of characters for a fee.
    - **Cosmetic Purchases:** Allow users to buy different "skins" or accessories for their Shimejis.
    - **Patreon/Donation Model:** Allow fans of the extension to support its development.
